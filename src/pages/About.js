        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Sarah and I'm passionate about user experience, efficient code, and making things make sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          My interest in design and web development started at age 12 when I started learning HTML and CSS from free resources online. I enjoyed creating small websites for my favourite cartoon characters and making custom themes on MySpace.
        </p>
        <p>
          After an adventurous 5 years working in Japan, I decided to return to Canada and revisit my childhood hobby of creating websites. Now, I'm focused on pursuing web development as a career.

          Fun fact: My older brother gifted me a book titled <strong>How to Do Everything with HTML</strong> in the early 2000's &#8212; I still own it to this day.
